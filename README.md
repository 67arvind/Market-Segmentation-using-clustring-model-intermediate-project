Enhance Product Offerings: Use insights from segmentation to refine existing products and develop new offerings that meet the specific needs of different customer groups.
# Data Sources
SBI Life Insurance Data: Customer demographics, policy types, premium amounts, claim history, and customer feedback.
Credit Card Data: Customer demographics, spending patterns, payment history, credit limits, and usage frequency.
# Methodology
Data Collection: Gather data from internal databases and customer surveys.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the data to understand trends, distributions, and relationships among variables.
Segmentation Techniques:
K-Means Clustering: To identify distinct customer segments based on features such as age, income, spending behavior, and insurance needs.
